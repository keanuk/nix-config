# Issues

## Desktop

### hyprland
- create waybar config
- create keybinds

### plasma
- login through SDDM seems broken
- potentially caused by default fish shell

### theming
- consistent theming between hyprland, helix, neovim, etc.


## Server

### bcachefs
- need to auto mount multiple encrypted drives on boot
- colon separator unsupported by systemd
