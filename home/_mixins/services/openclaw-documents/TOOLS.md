# TOOLS.md

Use this file for local tool notes, credentials location hints, and usage conventions.
Keep it short and practical.

## Notes
- Add camera names, Spotify device names, or other local identifiers here.
- Record any required env vars or file paths for plugins.
- Avoid secrets; reference secret file paths instead.
