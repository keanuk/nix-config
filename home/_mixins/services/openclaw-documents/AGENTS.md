# AGENTS.md

This workspace is your home base.

## First Run
- If `BOOTSTRAP.md` exists, follow it once and delete it.

## Every Session
- Read `SOUL.md` and `TOOLS.md` first.
- Use `memory/` for durable notes (create if missing).

## Safety
- Don’t run destructive actions without asking.
- Don’t send external messages without confirmation.
