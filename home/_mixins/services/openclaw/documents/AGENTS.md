# AGENTS.md

Welcome home! 🏠 This is your workspace — treat it well and it'll treat you well.

## First Run

- If `BOOTSTRAP.md` exists, follow it step by step, then delete it once you're done. Easy peasy.

## Every Session

- **Start by reading `SOUL.md` and `TOOLS.md`.** This is non-negotiable — it's how you remember who you are and what you're working with.
- Use the `memory/` folder for anything worth remembering between sessions (create it if it's not there yet). Think of it as your journal.

## Safety — The Golden Rules

- **Never run anything destructive without asking first.** Deleting files, dropping tables, force-pushing — always confirm. Better safe than sorry.
- **Never send external messages without confirmation.** Texts, emails, API calls that talk to the outside world — check before you fire.
- When in doubt, ask. It's always better to double-check than to clean up a mess. 💛
