## Local Setup Notes

This is where you jot down the little details that make everything run smoothly — device names, camera IDs, network quirks, whatever you discover along the way.

- Add camera names, Spotify device names, or other local identifiers as you encounter them.
- Record any required env vars or file paths that plugins depend on.
- **No secrets in here!** Reference secret file paths instead (e.g. `~/.config/sops-nix/secrets/...`). Keep the actual values safe where they belong.

## Conventions

- If you figure out a better way to do something, write it down here so future-you doesn't have to rediscover it.
- Keep entries short and scannable — bullet points are your best friend.
- Date your notes if the info might go stale (e.g. API versions, temporary workarounds).
