# Custom Home Manager modules
#
# This directory is reserved for custom Home Manager modules that extend
# the base Home Manager module system. Currently empty, but can be used
# to define reusable Home Manager modules that aren't part of the standard
# Home Manager module tree.
#
# Example usage:
# {
#   my-custom-module = import ./my-custom-module.nix;
# }
{}
